# Testing and Quality Assurance Plan

## 1. Automated Unit & Integration Tests
- Ensure all core JS modules (e.g., `app.js`, `layout.js`, tool logic) have unit tests.
- Use a framework like Jest for JavaScript testing.
- Add/expand tests in the `__tests__/` directory.

## 2. Accessibility Testing
- Integrate axe-core or Lighthouse for automated accessibility checks.
- Add a script or npm task to run these checks on your main HTML pages.

## 3. Manual QA
- Test the app in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Test on mobile and desktop screen sizes.

## 4. Continuous Integration (CI)
- Set up GitHub Actions or another CI tool to run tests on every PR.

## 5. Error Boundaries & Fallbacks
- Review error handling in your JS (e.g., try/catch, user feedback for failures).

## 6. Documentation & Developer Experience
- Expand and update the main README.md with setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- Add inline code comments and JSDoc/TSDoc for key functions and modules.
- Create onboarding docs for new contributors (e.g., project structure, coding standards).
- Document environment variables, build steps, and deployment process.
- Ensure all tools and features are discoverable and documented for both users and developers.

## 7. Security & Privacy Enhancements
- Review and sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS and injection attacks.
- Ensure secure handling of any uploaded files or external resources.
- Audit dependencies for vulnerabilities (e.g., using npm audit).
- Implement or review a privacy policy and cookie consent if needed.
- Review access controls and permissions for any sensitive features.

## 8. Layout Generator App Improvements
- Optimize canvas rendering for large or complex layouts.
- Implement lazy loading for heavy assets (e.g., preset libraries, images).
- Add loading skeletons or progress indicators for long operations.
- Allow users to save and load custom layout presets.
- Add undo/redo functionality for layout changes.
- Enable export to more formats (SVG, PNG, PDF with selectable text).
- Support drag-and-drop for images and elements on the canvas.
- Ensure all canvas controls are keyboard accessible.
- Provide ARIA labels and roles for custom UI components.
- Offer high-contrast and color-blind friendly palette options.
- Add the ability to share layouts via link or export/import JSON.
- Enable real-time collaboration (if feasible) or comments/annotations.
- Add tooltips and contextual help for complex controls.
- Provide onboarding walkthroughs or sample projects.
- Integrate anonymous usage analytics (with user consent).
- Add a feedback form or bug report feature.
- Refine the UI for touch and small screens, especially the canvas and sidebars.
- Sanitize all user-generated content and file uploads.
- Review third-party dependencies for vulnerabilities.
