# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the integration of Supabase as a comprehensive Content Management System (CMS) and backend solution for the image converter app. The integration will provide user management, authentication, database storage, file handling, payment processing, and analytics capabilities to transform the current client-side tool collection into a full-featured web application with user accounts, premium features, and data persistence.

The solution will maintain the existing vanilla HTML + JavaScript frontend architecture while staying within Vercel and Supabase free tier limits through strict usage enforcement. Stripe integration is mandatory for premium upgrades, with a dedicated user dashboard for subscription management.

**Technical Constraints:**
- Must remain on Vercel free tier (no paid add-ons)
- Must remain on Supabase free tier (500MB DB, 50MB storage, 100K API requests/month)
- Frontend architecture stays vanilla HTML + JavaScript (no React/Next.js migration)
- Hard usage caps enforced client-side and via Supabase Edge Functions
- Stripe Customer Portal integration required for subscription management

## Requirements

4. WHEN the system needs to query data THEN it SHALL use efficient indexes and relationships to ensure fast response times
5. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL implement row-level security to protect user privacy
6. WHEN the database schema changes THEN the system SHALL support migrations without data loss

### Requirement 3: File Storage with Free-Tier Guardrails

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload and store files within clear usage limits, so that I can manage my work while understanding my plan constraints and upgrade options.
