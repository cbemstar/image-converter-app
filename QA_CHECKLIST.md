## Automated Testing Commands

Run these commands to verify the migration:

```bash
# Visual regression testing
node scripts/visual-regression-test.js

# Accessibility audit
node scripts/accessibility-audit.js

# Mobile responsiveness check
node scripts/mobile-responsiveness-check.js

# Final consistency check
node scripts/final-consistency-check.js
```

## Manual Testing Steps

### 1. Homepage Testing
1. Load the homepage
2. Verify tool cards display correctly
3. Test search functionality
4. Test category filtering
5. Test theme toggle
6. Test sidebar navigation

### 2. Individual Tool Testing
For each tool:
1. Navigate to the tool
2. Test basic functionality
3. Verify styling consistency
4. Test responsive behavior
5. Check for console errors

### 3. Theme Testing
1. Switch between light/dark themes
2. Verify colors update correctly
3. Check localStorage persistence
4. Test on different tools

### 4. Navigation Testing
1. Test sidebar open/close
2. Verify all links work
3. Test breadcrumb navigation
4. Check mobile navigation

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
1. **Some hardcoded colors in JavaScript**: These are functional colors (like in color palette tool) and don't affect the design system
2. **Legacy inline styles in complex tools**: These are for dynamic content and don't impact the overall design consistency
3. **Focus indicators**: Some tools may need enhanced focus styling for better accessibility

### Workarounds
- Use the provided scripts to identify and fix remaining issues
- Refer to `test-shadcn-styling.html` for component examples
- Check the migration report for detailed guidance

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Week 1
- [ ] Monitor for user feedback
- [ ] Check analytics for any issues
- [ ] Verify performance metrics
- [ ] Test on additional devices

### Week 2-4
- [ ] Gather user experience feedback
- [ ] Monitor error logs
- [ ] Check accessibility compliance
- [ ] Plan any necessary refinements

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered:

1. **Immediate rollback**: Revert to previous commit
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD~3  # Revert last 3 commits
   ```

2. **Partial rollback**: Revert specific files
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~3 -- styles/styles.css
   ```

3. **Emergency fix**: Use legacy classes temporarily
   - Add `.layout-btn` classes back to critical buttons
   - Restore old color variables if needed

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All 19 tools display correctly
- ✅ No functionality is broken
- ✅ Visual consistency is maintained
- ✅ Performance is not degraded
- ✅ Accessibility score is 75%+
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness score is 80%+
